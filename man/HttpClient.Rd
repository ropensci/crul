\item{url}{(character) A url. One of \code{url} or \code{handle} required.}

\item{opts}{(list) curl options, a named list. See
\code{\link[curl]{curl_options}} for available curl options}

\item{proxies}{an object of class \code{proxy}, as returned from the
\code{\link{proxy}} function. Supports one proxy for now}

\item{auth}{result of a call to the \code{\link{auth}} function,
e.g. \code{auth(user = "foo", pwd = "bar")}}

\item{headers}{(list) a named list of headers}

\strong{Methods}
\describe{
\item{\code{get(path, query, disk, stream, ...)}}{
Make a GET request
}
\item{\code{post(path, query, body, disk, stream, ...)}}{
Make a POST request
}
\item{\code{put(path, query, body, disk, stream, ...)}}{
Make a PUT request
}
\item{\code{patch(path, query, body, disk, stream, ...)}}{
Make a PATCH request
}
\item{\code{delete(path, query, body, disk, stream, ...)}}{
Make a DELETE request
}
\item{\code{head(path, query, ...)}}{
Make a HEAD request
}
\item{\code{retry(verb, ..., pause_base = 1, pause_cap = 60, pause_min = 1, times = 3, terminate_on, retry_only_on)}}{
Retries the request given by \code{verb} until successful (HTTP response
status < 400), or a condition for giving up is met. Automatically
recognizes \code{Retry-After} and \code{X-RateLimit-Reset} headers in the
response for rate-limited remote APIs.
}
\item{\code{handle_pop()}}{
reset your curl handle
}
\item{\code{url_fetch(path, query)}}{
get the URL that would be sent (i.e., before executing the request).
the only things that change the URL are path and query
parameters; body and any curl options don't change the URL
- returns: URL as a character vector
}
}

Possible parameters (not all are allowed in each HTTP verb):
\itemize{
\item \code{path} - URL path, appended to the base URL
\item \code{query} - query terms, as a named list
\item \code{body} - body as an R list
\item \code{encode} - one of form, multipart, json, or raw
\item \code{disk} - a path to write to. if NULL (default), memory used.
See \code{\link[curl:curl_fetch_disk]{curl::curl_fetch_disk()}} for help.
\item \code{stream} - an R function to determine how to stream data. if
NULL (default), memory used. See \code{\link[curl:curl_fetch_stream]{curl::curl_fetch_stream()}}
for help
\item \code{...} For \code{retry}, the options to be passed on to the method
implementing the requested verb, including curl options. Otherwise,
curl options, only those in the acceptable set from \code{\link[curl:curl_options]{curl::curl_options()}}
except the following: httpget, httppost, post, postfields, postfieldsize,
and customrequest
\item \code{pause_base,pause_cap,pause_min} - basis, maximum, and minimum for
calculating wait time for retry. Wait time is calculated according to the
exponential backoff with full jitter algorithm. Specifically, wait time is
chosen randomly between \code{pause_min} and the lesser of \code{pause_base * 2} and
\code{pause_cap}, with \code{pause_base} doubling on each subsequent retry attempt.
Use \code{pause_cap = Inf} to not terminate retrying due to cap of wait time
reached.
\item \code{times} - the maximum number of times to retry. Set to \code{Inf} to
not stop retrying due to exhausting the number of attempts.
\item \code{terminate_on,retry_only_on} - a vector of HTTP status codes. For
\code{terminate_on}, the status codes for which to terminate retrying, and for
\code{retry_only_on}, the status codes for which to retry the request.
}
}
\note{
A little quirk about \code{crul} is that because user agent string can
be passed as either a header or a curl option (both lead to a \code{User-Agent}
header being passed in the HTTP request), we return the user agent
string in the \code{request_headers} list of the response even if you
pass in a \code{useragent} string as a curl option. Note that whether you pass
in as a header like \code{User-Agent} or as a curl option like \code{useragent},
it is returned as \code{request_headers$User-Agent} so at least accessing
it in the request headers is consistent.
}
\section{handles}{

curl handles are re-used on the level of the connection object, that is,
each \code{HttpClient} object is separate from one another so as to better
separate connections.

If you don't pass in a curl handle to the \code{handle} parameter,
it gets created when a HTTP verb is called. Thus, if you try to get \code{handle}
after creating a \code{HttpClient} object only passing \code{url} parameter, \code{handle}
will be \code{NULL}. If you pass a curl handle to the \code{handle parameter, then you can get the handle from the }HttpClient\code{object. The response from a http verb request does have the handle in the}handle` slot.

# set your own handle
(h <- handle("https://httpbin.org"))
(x <- HttpClient$new(handle = h))
x$handle
x$url

x$handle

# if you just pass a url, we create a handle for you
#  this is how most people will use HttpClient
(x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org"))

x$handle # is empty, it gets created when a HTTP verb is called
(r1 <- x$get('get'))

# post request
(res_post <- x$post('post', body = list(hello = "world")))

## empty body request
x$post('post')

# put request
(res_put <- x$put('put'))

# delete request
(res_delete <- x$delete('delete'))

# patch request
(res_patch <- x$patch('patch'))

# head request
(res_head <- x$head())

# retry, by default at most 3 times
(res_get <- x$retry("GET", path = "status/400"))

# retry, but not for 404 NOT FOUND
(res_get <- x$retry("GET", path = "status/404", terminate_on = c(404)))

# retry, but only for exceeding rate limit (note that e.g. Github uses 403)
(res_get <- x$retry("GET", path = "status/429", retry_only_on = c(403, 429)))

# query params are URL encoded for you, so DO NOT do it yourself
## if you url encode yourself, it gets double encoded, and that's bad
(x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org"))
res <- x$get("get", query = list(a = 'hello world'))

# get full url before the request is made
(x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org"))
x$url_fetch()
x$url_fetch('get')
x$url_fetch('post')
x$url_fetch('get', query = list(foo = "bar"))
