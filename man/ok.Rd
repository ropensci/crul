\title{check if a url is okay}
\usage{
ok(x, status = 200L, info = TRUE, verb = "head", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a URL as a character string, or an object of
class \link{HttpClient}}

\item{status}{(integer) one or more HTTP status codes, must be integers.
default: \code{200L}, since this is the most common signal
that a URL is okay, but there may be cases in which your URL
is okay if it's a \code{201L}, or some other status code.}

\item{info}{(logical) in the case of an error, do you want a
\code{message()} about it? Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{verb}{(character) use "head" (default) or "get" HTTP verb
for the request. note that "get" will take longer as it returns a
body. however, "verb=get" may be your only option if a url
blocks head requests}

\item{...}{args passed on to \link{HttpClient}}
}
\value{
a single boolean, if \code{TRUE} the URL is up and okay,
if \code{FALSE} it is down.
}
\description{
check if a url is okay
}
\details{
We internally verify that status is an integer and
in the known set of HTTP status codes, and that info is a boolean

You may have to fiddle with the parameters to \code{ok()} as well as
curl options to get the "right answer". If you think you are getting
incorrectly getting \code{FALSE}, the first thing to do is to pass in
\code{verbose=TRUE} to \code{ok()}. That will give you verbose curl output and will
help determine what the issue may be. Here's some different scenarios:
\itemize{
\item the site blocks head requests: some sites do this, try \code{verb="get"}
\item it will be hard to determine a site that requires this, but it's
worth trying a random useragent string, e.g., \code{ok(useragent = "foobar")}
\item some sites are up and reachable but you could get a 403 Unauthorized
error, there's nothing you can do in this case other than having access
\item its possible to get a weird HTTP status code, e.g., LinkedIn gives
a 999 code, they're trying to prevent any programmatic access

\examples{
\dontrun{
# 200
ok("https://google.com") 
# 200
ok("https://httpbin.org/status/200")
# more than one status
ok("https://google.com", status = c(200L, 202L))
# 404
ok("https://httpbin.org/status/404")
# doesn't exist
ok("https://stuff.bar")
# doesn't exist
ok("stuff")

# use get verb instead of head
ok("http://animalnexus.ca")
ok("http://animalnexus.ca", verb = "get")

# some urls will require a different useragent string
# they probably regex the useragent string
ok("https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjq042")
ok("https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjq042", verb = "get", useragent = "foobar")

# with HttpClient
z <- crul::HttpClient$new("https://httpbin.org/status/404", 
 opts = list(verbose = TRUE))
ok(z)
}
