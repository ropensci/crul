\description{
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
}
\section{The PATCH method}{

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.  The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch
document" identified by a media type.  If the Request-URI does not
point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource,
depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify
a null resource) and permissions, etc.

See \url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-2} for further
details.
