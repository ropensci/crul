An HTTP client, taking inspiration from Ruby's [faraday](https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday) and Python's `requests`

Package documentation: <https://docs.ropensci.org/crul/>

Some Features:

* `HttpClient` - Main interface to making HTTP requests. Synchronous requests only.
* `HttpResponse` - HTTP response object, used for all responses across the
different clients.
* `Paginator` - Auto-paginate through requests - supports a subset of all possible
pagination scenarios - will fill out more scenarios soon
* `Async` - Asynchronous HTTP requests - a simple interface for many URLS -
whose interface is similar to `HttpClient` - all URLs are treated the same.
* `AsyncVaried` - Asynchronous HTTP requests - accepts any number of `HttpRequest`
objects - with a different interface than `HttpClient`/`Async` due to the nature
of handling requests with different HTTP methods, options, etc.
* set curl options globally: `set_auth()`, `set_headers()`, and more
* Writing to disk and streaming: available with both synchronous requests
as well as async requests
* Hooks on requests and responses are available in the `HttpClient` method only, 
and allow you to trigger functions to run on requests or responses, or both.
See `?hooks` for the details and examples
* Mocking: `crul` integrates with [webmockr](https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr) to mock
HTTP requests. Checkout the [http testing book][book]
* Test caching: `crul` also integrates with [vcr](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr) to cache http requests/responses. Checkout the [http testing book][book]

* Please note that this package is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* Where does the package name come from? It was a play on "curl", the popular command line client.
* Where does the sticker design come from? The sticker idea [arose from a tweet](https://github.com/ropensci/crul/issues/42) - crul is close (ish) to Krull, a 1980's movie with a "mystical five-pointed weapon". The association with Krull was not known before naming the package.
